I am interested in building a game related to escape the room game plays. Players can explore different rooms and find clues to escape. There could be multiple levels and players can find items to use to help them escape. There will be a storyline and depending on the choices of the players different rooms will be unlock. Some rooms will have time limits where player have to escape within time or else it will lead them to a bad ending.
